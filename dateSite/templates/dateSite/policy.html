            <p>
                When you visit any website, you are providing a range of personal information to the owners of the website about your visit, depending on what actions you take.

You should always ask if the site does not make the necessary information available to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will only use the information you send to us during your visit for the purposes of internal tracking. This includes the activities of making Meetlove.com effective for you to use and making appropriate responses to your requests for information and other features or services.

            <h4>II. Notice</h4>
            <p>
                When you visit Meetlove.com, we make a record of the Internet provider’s domain name and country that you visited from (e.g., ‘aol.com’) and the course you take as you navigate from one page to another (i.e., “click stream” activity).
                Information requests and visitor registration
                When you use or register on the Meetlove.com website, we only collect personal information that you provide of your own accord. “Personal information” includes that which can identify you as a certain individual, such as your name or email.

                Use of cookies and browsing data
                We use cookie technology on Meetlove.com as part of the statistical reporting on our website. A cookie is a small piece of information delivered by a website that is saved to your hard disk by the browser on your computer. It contains information used by a website to make your experience more personal (e.g. rotating profiles on the Meetlove.com home page) and to gather statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded during your experience, the domain name and country of the internet provider that you have come from (e.g. ‘aol.com’, or ‘umich.edu’), and addresses of those websites you have visited just before, and after, coming to Meetlove.com. Nevertheless, we do not associate any of this information with you as an individual. Only an aggregate measure is taken. Cookie information allows us to follow your “click stream” activity (i.e., how visitors navigate our site as they move from page to page). It is important to note that cookies never capture your individual email address or any of your private information.

Although we collect information on site traffic we do not record information on particular visitors to our site, which means that no information about you as an individual is retained or used.You are able to browse the website without cookies by configuring your browser to reject all cookies, or to give you warning when a cookie is set. However, because every browser is different you should refer to the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
